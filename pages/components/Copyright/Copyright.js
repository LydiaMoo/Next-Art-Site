    <p>The colouring pages I provide are copyright-protected. I have offered these for free for your personal, non-commercial use only within your household. Mass-production of these coloring pages is not permitted, even for non-profit purposes. Likewise, mass-redistribution of any of the digital files I give away is also not permitted. This means you are not permitted to upload these blank coloring pages to other sites - instead, if you want to let people know about these free colouring pages, you are welcome to post a link to the appropriate page on my website.
